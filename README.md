## Intro
Thank you to Rooster Grin for allowing me the opportunity to take your Evaluation and practice my coding skills. 

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to create a client website that has some key features requested by the client (i.e. Rooster Grin as the client).

##
1. I used HTML, CSS, and Boostrap 5 with limited JS.

2. I struggled with utilizing the grid features and organizing the customizations between CSS and Bootstrap. The biggest struggle was time. I would have liked to do so much more.

3. I really enjoyed working with Bootstrap 5 again and had a great time making the carousel. Most of all, I enjoyed the excuse to code.
