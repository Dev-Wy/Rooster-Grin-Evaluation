## Intro
Thank you to Rooster Grin for allowing me the opportunity to take your Evaluation and practice my coding skills. 

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to create a client website that has some key features requested by the client (i.e. Rooster Grin as the client).

##
1. I used HTML, CSS, and Boostrap 5 with limited JS.

2. I had not had previous experience with animations or transitions. I learned a great deal. The biggest struggle was time. I will enjoy tinkering on this project in the future.

3. I really enjoyed working with Bootstrap 5 again and had a great time making the carousel. Using animations and trying my hand at transitions was quite inspiring. However, I mainly enjoyed the excuse to code.
