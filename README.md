## Overview

## My Process
### Built with
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap5
- JavaScript

### What I learned
- I had not had previous experience with animations or transitions. I learned a great deal. 
- I also learned how to blend Bootstrap into my CSS rather than coding the majority with it. 
- I enjoyed tinkering with the carousal section which was also new to me.

### Continued development
- I would like to learn more about the hover transition and timing for animations. I will enjoy tinkering on this project in the future.
- I would also like to learn how to outline text. This was something I attempted but in the end decided to forgo for other aspects of the projects.
